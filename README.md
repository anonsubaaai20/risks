# Escaping from Risks using Automated Planning

Benchmarks used in the AAAI'20 submission. 

For each domain, the escape planning tasks employed are located in the 'experiments' subdirectory.

In each escape planning task directory, there are at least 3 files:

  - Domain file
  - Problem file
  - Risks file, under the name of 'goals.txt'. Each line in the file contains the risky state and its weight.
